**Introduction**

CCTV camera use is becoming more and more widespread, especially for
security

purposes. Such surveillance tactics must be weighed against the privacy
rights of those

being watched, though. Closed-circuit TV, IP camera, and video
surveillance systems

have almost become pervasive and necessary for many enterprises,
organizations, and

people. Physical security, increased safety, and crime prevention are
their primary goals.

They also become more complicated, containing several communication
channels,

embedded hardware, and complicated firmware. The majority of research to
far, however,

has mostly addressed the privacy concerns of such systems and has not
sufficiently

addressed their problems with cyber-security in general and attacks on
the visual layer

> (i.e., imagery semantics) in particular.

Based on publicly accessible data, I undertake a thorough analysis of
the recent and

ongoing threats to IPcamera, closed-circuit TV, and video surveillance
systems in this

study. The information gained from these insights can subsequently be
utilized to better

comprehend and identify the security and privacy issues connected to the
creation,

distribution, and usage of these systems. When evaluating the
cyber-security level of

current or new CCTV designs and deployments, include both existing and
innovative

threats, along with their current or potential countermeasures, and
summarize this

> knowledge.

> Where, \
> 1. s88 -\> the port number on the IP camera. \
> 2. l admin -\> default login name that will be used (admin). \
> 3. p /root/desktop/pass.txt -\> your password list file.  e -\> empty
> password. 4. ns -\> try login and empty password.

> screenshot. This is another approach to exploit firmware.
